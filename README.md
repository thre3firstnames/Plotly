#  Exploring Belly Button Biodiversity with Plotly
## Overview & Summary
Using Plotly with Javascript, HTML, ass CSS, I used the biodiversity data contained with a JSON file to generate a mobile-responsive and interactive dashboard based on the bacteria found in each subjectâ€™s belly button. The generated charts illustrate the top ten bacteria found, the number of times each subject washes their belly button, and a plot of all cultures found arranged by **OTU ID**.
